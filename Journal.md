## Mockup for size decisions
To decide the size of the eventual board, I created two different mockups. One mockup used 1" squares, and had a 17x17 resolution. The other had 2" squares, and an 11x11 resolution. After creating them and displaying both, my dad (who this project is for) decided he liked the smaller 1" squares. The mockups only used 2-tone, but it was decided that having gray-scale and/or RGB would be beneficial. Below are the two mockups.
