# LED-ART
  
Brendan Weibel

## Summary
This project is a simple LED light array art piece. The art piece will consist of a 20x20 grid of 1" LEDs and a camera. The camera will take a picture every 
X seconds, and then display it on the board. There will also be a small set of controls on the side of the piece, which will allow for pictures to be stored and/or displayed, filters to be applied to the images (Grayscale, 2-tone, potentially more), and potentially pictures to be uploaded via SD card.

This project will most likely use a microcontroller (Arduino of some sort), and various embedded engineering principles. Potentially also includes FPGA programming, if doing computations on camera images is costly on the microcontroller.
